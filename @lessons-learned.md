[2024-03-28 15:35] Component Setup: Issue: Installing shadcn/ui with React 19 requires special handling due to peer dependency conflicts → Fix: Used --force flag during installation as recommended by shadcn/ui documentation → Why: Critical for ensuring proper component installation while maintaining React 19 compatibility, preventing potential dependency resolution issues in the development environment. #setup #dependency-management 

[2024-03-28 15:41] Performance Optimization: Issue: HTML-to-image conversion can be resource-intensive and may cause UI freezing → Fix: Implemented loading state management and optimized image generation with proper quality and pixelRatio settings → Why: Essential for providing good UX during image generation process and ensuring high-quality output while maintaining responsive UI. #performance #ux 

[2024-03-28 15:55] Security Practices: Issue: Direct HTML rendering can pose XSS risks when accepting user input → Fix: Implemented proper error handling and input validation for HTML/SVG content, used controlled components for file uploads → Why: Critical for preventing security vulnerabilities while maintaining functionality, ensures safe rendering of user-provided HTML content. #security #input-validation

[2024-03-28 16:00] Performance Optimization: Issue: Direct DOM rendering can include unwanted UI elements and styles in image output → Fix: Implemented off-screen rendering with resource loading checks and proper cleanup → Why: Essential for generating clean images from HTML content while ensuring all resources are properly loaded and preventing memory leaks. #performance #resource-management

[2024-03-28 16:05] Performance Optimization: Issue: Complex off-screen rendering can introduce inconsistencies and unnecessary DOM manipulation → Fix: Utilized direct preview element conversion while maintaining resource loading checks → Why: Simplifies the conversion process while ensuring WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) output and maintaining reliable image generation. #performance #ux

[2024-07-11 15:00] Documentation: Issue: Generic template README lacking project-specific information and usefulness → Fix: Created comprehensive README with detailed feature descriptions, accurate tech stack, installation steps, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines → Why: Essential for providing clear first impression to users and contributors, setting correct expectations about application capabilities, and reducing onboarding friction for new developers by documenting the exact purpose and functionality of the application.

[2024-07-11 15:30] Dependency Management: Issue: Missing peer dependencies when using component libraries like shadcn/ui can cause TypeScript errors → Fix: Identify and install required packages by examining error messages and component library documentation → Why: Component libraries often have modular architecture where each component may have its own dependencies (like @radix-ui/react-label) that need to be installed separately, especially when using TypeScript which requires both runtime code and type declarations.

[2024-07-11 16:00] Build Process: Issue: Next.js build process may fail due to ESLint errors that weren't detected during development → Fix: Address ESLint warnings including replacing any types with specific types, fixing dependency arrays in useEffect hooks, and using Next.js Image component → Why: Next.js enforces code quality through ESLint during builds, and failing to address these issues can prevent deployment and lead to runtime performance issues, especially with images where Next.js Image component provides automatic optimization.

[2024-07-11 16:30] Performance Optimization: Issue: React recreates function references on every render causing unnecessary re-renders and useEffect dependency issues → Fix: Use useCallback hook with proper dependency arrays for functions referenced in useEffect or passed to child components → Why: Critical for preventing infinite re-render loops and optimizing performance by memoizing function references, especially when those functions are dependencies of useEffect hooks or passed as props to memoized components.
